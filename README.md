## Introduction

**CapsMapper** is a program to remap your keyboard. Its main features are:

* Remap your keyboard through an easy to use interface
* Runs quietly in the background with access to the interface through the icon in the system tray
* Suppress the lock key event while still remapping your keys
* Easily deactivate remappings and settings
* Activate remapping only when specified programs are the active foreground window
* Supports multiple profiles, easily create, duplicate, and share profiles

## Issues

* Some scan codes are not unique resulting in keystrokes / remappings not being possible
* The up, down, right, left buttons only send the numpad equivalent key

## Support
